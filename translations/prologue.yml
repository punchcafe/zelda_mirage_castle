    Neither past nor future.
    Not of this earth,
    yet nor does it exist in the sea of infinite stars across the universe.
    It is within you.
    The you that always dreams of something more.
    The you that yearns for adventure.
    It is the world of fantasy which exists in your mind.

    In a corner of that vast land lies nestled a kingdom called Hyrule.
    Within Hyrule was a sacred and secret relic; three golden traingles which protected the kingdom from strife and kept it safe. #
    Together, these three triangles were known as the Triforce.
    Once upon a time, an evil demon king appeared from the dark world, and stole the Triforce.
    That demon king's name was Ganon.
    From that terrible moment, Hyrule's peace was shattered, and Hyrule was transformed into a terrifying hellscape, where marauding monsters caused havoc where they went.
    To make things worse, Ganon captured the princess of Hyrule, Zelda, and sealed her deep within the labryinths below Death Mountain.
